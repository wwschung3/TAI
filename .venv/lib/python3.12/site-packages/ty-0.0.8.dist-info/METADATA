ty is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Highlights

- 10x - 100x faster than mypy and Pyright
- Comprehensive [diagnostics](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/diagnostics/) with rich contextual information
- Configurable [rule levels](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/rules/), [per-file overrides](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/configuration/#overrides), [suppression comments](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/suppression/), and first-class project support
- Designed for adoption, with support for [redeclarations](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#redeclarations) and [partially typed code](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#gradual-guarantee)
- [Language server](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/language-server/) with code navigation, completions, code actions, auto-import, inlay hints, on-hover help, etc.
- Fine-grained [incremental analysis](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/language-server/#fine-grained-incrementality) designed for fast updates when editing files in an IDE
- Editor integrations for [VS Code](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/editors/#vs-code), [PyCharm](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/editors/#pycharm), [Neovim](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/editors/#neovim) and more
- Advanced typing features like first-class [intersection types](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#intersection-types), advanced [type narrowing](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#top-and-bottom-materializations), and
    [sophisticated reachability analysis](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#reachability-based-on-types)
